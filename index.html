    <p class="p1">Don’t forget to keep your bag or at least hand-kerchief in your chair before leaving or else you should be ready to sit on floor. I adopted the first method. So, my chair escaped. Then again clicked the play button.
At last the movie got over. I looked around the bay, everyone was busy doing their work. I got a feeling somewhere in the edge of my heart, “Are we wasting our time”. Then immediately, I opened the company browser and searched for some online courses that can be completed in 10 – 15 days. As usual got lacs of results. I clicked on the first link, a pop-up opened stating “The site become unresponsive”. Then I clicked the second link, again a pop-up opened stating “The site become unresponsive”. I felt ‘uh’.Then I clicked the third link, again the same pop-up stating, “The site become unresponsive and clearly notifies a message because of the long time, the session is not responding, and will give an option to kill the page or continue with the process”. A doubt cracked in my mind, the systems lying in the ITP location for a long time may be a reason for its slowness. Then, there from, I have got a clear message, lying in the bench for long time intervals is never good for system and employees too. Then I put that computer to sleep mode. Slowly again took my phone to watch the second movie. But Battery low. Note: Please don’t forget to take the charging cable. Then after a nap, marked my evening attendance and successfully completed my first day of bench. Still stories yet to come.
