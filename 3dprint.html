<strong>Interest to create:</strong>

The first and foremost important step is to have interest in creating the 3d design and curiosity to see it in the reality.

Make sure you have a creativity, interest to do things and little time to spare to learn things.

Before we go into the 3d modeling lets see under what category you come under:
<ol>
	<li>Make sure what you wanted to create that depends on you, there are basically two primary factors for the considerations
<ul>
	<li>Engineering based 3d modelling (Manufacture quality)</li>
	<li>Creative modelling (Art type)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Engineering based modelling is one which is made according to the various dimension properties of the model. It is considered that each and every thing is measured and created.</li>
	<li>Creative Modelling is creating the 3d models as per the minds creativity and does't care much about the dimension parameters.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Engineering based 3d modelling</strong>

By the by , if you are Engineering students you might be familiar with the first semester Engineering Graphics where you are made to create some of the drawings, this something similar to that but don't be afraid, it is so easy than what you think.!!
<ol>
	<li>Make notes of the part which you need to model, make a rough sketch with the dimensions in the paper.</li>
	<li>Start drawing the things in the software and extrude in the 3d space and thus it will be made as a 3d model and you can just export the file in the stl format for 3d printing and load it into the 3d printer to print.</li>
</ol>
IN THIS I AM GOING TO SHARE ABOUT THE ENGINEERING BASED 3D MODELLING..... without wasting much time lets move to the first section...!!

this is the video version of this instructables you may follow it in the youtube https://www.youtube.com/timedtext_video?v=UNyMw59gKoI

<h2 id="step2" class="step-title">Step 2: Making Notes of the Dimensions</h2>
<div class="step-body">

The main Important aspect is to make notes of the dimensions and other details of the things which you are going to work on.

Whatever may be the thing you must know the exact dimensions, angle and strength of the material on which you are going to print for your purpose.

<strong>For example</strong> : Here I am going to explain by taking a cube with a hole in the center.

<strong>Dimensions </strong>: The size of the cube is 50 mm, the diameter of the circular hole i consider for my purpose is 20 mm,

I am in need of the semi thick material so i take ABS plastic as a 3d printing material.

<strong>NOTE:</strong>

(I don't want to get in detail about the selection of the dimensions or the material, you may decide according to your pupose, for further clarification you may google and see what are the different materials available in 3d printing )

<div class="step-body">

Another main confusion is what is the best software for the 3d designing. Answer is there are many software to suit this purpose but if you ask me I will suggest you to use Autodesk Fusion 360 .

Reason is It is very easy for the beginner aspect as well it suit the purpose for the high level simulations when compared to other softwares such as creo, ansis etc
<ol>
	<li>go to the link and download the software it is free for 1 year entrepreneur or 3 years free as student <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview" rel="nofollow">https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overv...</a></li>
	<li>Follow the installation procedure and start using it.</li>
	<li>There will be cloud storage for you and each and very design made is stored in the cloud and can be accessed or shared to any one easily.</li>
	<li>Other Important things to say about that software is we can see the designs form the fusion app as all the details are stored in the cloud.</li>
	<li>Nothing more after you use and get familiar with the software, you will love the plenty of the features in the software.</li>

<strong>Designing the Square:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Open the Fusion 360 software.</li>
	<li>Select the Sketch Option and click on the center point rectangle (any kind of rectangle or you can also draw with the lines as per your wish).</li>
	<li>Select the plane where you need to start the sketch. ( any plane this also your wish, here I select the bottom plane).</li>
	<li>Create the square by mentioning the distance of both sides as 50mm each.</li>
	<li>Even you forgot to do that you can dimension it any time by clicking the 'd' key or dimension in the sketch option.</li>
	<li>It is the 2d sketch, to make it a 3d model, Select on the Extrude option in the create tab or simply press 'E' key, then mention the distance as 50mm or -50 mm, (here "-" represents the direction of the extrusion.)</li>
	<li>Thus great you have created the first 3d model.!!!!!</li>
</ol>
<strong>Designing of the Hole in the Middle :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Select the Sketch Option and click on the center point circle.</li>
	<li>It is important to select the top or bottom face as the place to sketch.</li>
	<li>Create the circle of diameter 20 mm on the top face.</li>
	<li>Select the circle face and extrude the surface to the other side of the square and select the option as Cut.</li>
	<li>Great you have made the required 3d model.!!!!</li>
</ol>

From the designed model, the Engineering Drawing can be easily created as follows :

Creating the drawing
<ol>
	<li>Select the Drawing Option ->from design</li>
	<li>Then select the model you have created.</li>
	<li>Place the model base view in the center, then to get the top, side and front views, click on the project views and place in the required region.</li>
</ol>
Dimensioning the drawing:
<ol>
	<li>Select the dimension option and mark the required dimension for all the regions.</li>
	<li>The sides may highlight when the dimension option is selected or manually select the points for which the dimensions have to be made.</li>
	<li>Mark all the dimensions of the model specification such as circle diameter, projections or angles etc.</li>
	<li>Make the title and specify the drawings is in which measurement scale such as in mm, cm etc.</li>
</ol>
Note :
<ul>
	<li>All the texts in the drawings must be preferably in the capital letters</li>
	<li>Mention at the bottom as "ALL DIMENSIONS ARE IN MM " or CM etc like that...!!</li>
</ul>
That's awesome you made a professional Engineering Drawing good keep going....!!!

To really start printing, there is one major step to transform the stl file to set of G codes understandable by the 3d printer.

Software Required:
<ol>
	<li>There are custom software coming with the 3d printers, but for the general purpose we can use one of the opensource software called CURA form the ULTIMAKER printers. The link to the software is as follows<a href="https://ultimaker.com/en/products/cura-software" rel="nofollow">https://ultimaker.com/en/products/cura-software</a></li>
</ol>
Creating the G codes
<ol>
	<li>Open the stl file generated from the fusion 360.</li>
	<li>There select the options that suits you. (Select the infill amount such as 0 % to 100%, depending on the rigidity you want the output to be )</li>
	<li>At the bottom we can see the print output mass and the time taken to print. ( be patient for even for small print it takes hours).</li>
	<li>Finally select the option save to files as G codes. The set of the required G codes for the print is made.</li>
	<li>Thus paste the G code in the sd card and start the 3d printer.</li>
</ol>
SIIT BACK and relax....!!!
